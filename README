Description
---------------------
Use to cheat at Hanging With Friends (or other Hangman style games). The
solver takes the current board state, a list of incorrect guesses, and
suggests (1) what words are left, (2) what is your best letter (or what are
your best letters) to guess on your current turn.


The solver chooses a letter that minimizes the probability of striking out.
This is the optimal way of playing Hangman unless you have a priori knowledge
of how the opponent chooses words (which probably also involves knowing their
tiles)

The solver can also be run in a "generator" mode where, given a set of
letters, tells you the most difficult Hangman word you can construct with
them.

Usage
--------------------

./solvingwithfriends.py

Note that the prompts support readline history editing (e.g. up and down
arrows)

Enter "!" as the word to switch between solver and generator modes
