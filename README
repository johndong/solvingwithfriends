Description
---------------------
Use to cheat at Hanging With Friends (or other Hangman style games). The
solver takes the current board state, a list of incorrect guesses, and
suggests (1) what words are left, (2) what is your best letter (or what are
your best letters) to guess on your current turn.


The guess it suggests attempts to be information-theoretic optimal -- cutting
the number of options left in half no matter what the outcome of the guess is.
One can argue this is not the OPTIMAL Hangman solver because you have a
limited number of guesses, and a guess that gives you less information but
avoids a strike is better than a information-theoretic perfect guess that
costs you a strike.... That's being worked on.


Usage
